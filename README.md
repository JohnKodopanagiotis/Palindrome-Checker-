# Palindrome-Checker-
Palindrome Checker for freeCodeCamp part of JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification.
This function takes a string and checks if it is a palindrome* or not by removing all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) 
and turning everything into the same case (LowerCase) returning true or false.





*palindrome = a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards, e.g. madam or nurses run.
